🚨 Hotfix Rules
A hotfix is an urgent fix for something broken on main.
Hotfix branches use this format:
development/your-name/hotfix-issue-name

Example:
development/reza/hotfix-vercel-deployment

Hotfix rules:
Keep it very small.
Fix only the urgent issue.
Still use a Pull Request.
Get 2 reviewers if possible.
Notify the team on Slack immediately.
🔐 Git Security Rules
Never commit private environment files or API keys.
.gitignore must include:
.env
.env.local
.next
node_modules
.DS_Store

Only .env.example should be committed.
If an API key is accidentally committed:
Stop immediately.
Tell the team and mentors.
Remove the key from the repository.
Rotate the API key.
Check Git history.
Do not continue until fixed.
